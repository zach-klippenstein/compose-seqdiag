# samples

This module contains sample code for the docs. Ideally, it would be embedded in kdoc
with the `@sample` tag, but the amount of configuration seemingly required to make
that work is more than I'm willing to maintain at this time.

Samples here should have screenshot tests in the `seqdiag` module. Tests are in the
main module because they are tests for the library, and it's simpler and more
discoverable to have all those tests in the same place.
